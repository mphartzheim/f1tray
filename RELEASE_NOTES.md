## 🚀 Release Notes – v0.2.1-test.2 (2025-03-30)

### Testing
- Testing release scripts

### ✨ New Features
- **Clickable Driver Names**: Driver names in both standings and results now include a 👤 icon and can be clicked to open the driver’s biography. If a custom URL is available, it will be used—otherwise, it falls back to a Wikipedia link provided by the API.
- **Code Improvements**: Internal helper functions were added to simplify parsing logic and theme loading, reducing repetition and improving maintainability.

### 🛠️ Fixes
- **Tray Menu Reliability**: Resolved issues with tray menu items not appearing or behaving inconsistently across different themes.
- **Theme Highlighting**: Team themes now correctly apply highlight colors on first load without needing a manual refresh or tab switch.
